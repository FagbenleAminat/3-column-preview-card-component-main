## My process
I started this project based on my goals to have 10 projects in bags before the end of January.
Though it is a hard nut to crack but I enjoyed every bit of it.
It is funny how I  got stuck and forgot how to upload on git. Thanks to google my best friend.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

WOAH! 
My HTML is perfect here, I did less of googling and I grabbed lots of CSS too.
I'm begininning to love coding more.

### Continued development

I am surely taking more css related projects. I feel there is a lot to learn.
